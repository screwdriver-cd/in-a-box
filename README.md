# Screwdriver in a Box

This handy feature will bring up an entire Screwdriver instance (ui, api, and log store) locally
for you to play with.  All data written to a database will be stored in `data` directory.

Requires:
 - Python 2.7
 - Mac OSX 10.10+
 - [Docker for Mac][docker]
 - [Docker Compose 1.8.1+][docker-compose]


Run the below command in your terminal to bring up a Screwdriver cluster locally.

```bash
$ python <(curl -L https://git.io/screwdriver-box)
```
You will be prompted to enter your desired SCM provider as well as your Client ID and Client Secret. Afterwards, type `y` to launch Screwdriver!
